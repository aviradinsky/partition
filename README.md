# Code for Calculating the Partition of a Number

A repo containing code for calculating the [partitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_(number_theory)) of a number.

For more information on Partitions check out the wikipedia [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_(number_theory)).

# The Algorithm
The algorithm used was independantly discovered by me. It is not particularly novel or complex but it is correct.

# Use Information
Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aviradinsky/partition.git
```
Get the Python code:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aviradinsky/partition/main/python/partition.py
```
Get the Java code:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aviradinsky/partition/main/java/Partition.java
```
The Python implementation uses [caching](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.lru_cache) so it is much faster than the Java implementation.
