# Code for Calculating the Partition of a Number

A repo containing code for calculating the [partitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_(number_theory)) of a number.

For more information on Partitions check out the wikipedia [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_(number_theory)).

# The Algorithm
The algorithm used was independantly discovered by me. It is not particularly novel or complex but it is correct.

# Use Info
The Python implementation uses [caching](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.lru_cache) and the Java implementation does not.
\
\
I would therefore recommend using the Python implementation.

This project was inspired by the [Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoxcjq-8xIDTYp3uz647V5A) youtube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjCIq58rZ8I) on partitions.
